## Angular schema form add-ons - Documentation

This folder contains documentation of all of the ASF add-on architecture.

The [extending](https://github.com/OptimalBPM/angular-schema-form-add-ons/blob/master/documentation/extending.md)-document is a guide to extending ASF.

However, if you are new to creating add-on:s, it is recommended to first read the [creating a new add-on](https://github.com/OptimalBPM/angular-schema-form-add-ons/wiki/Creating-a-new-add-on)-article on the wiki.
