### Installation
To use the provided example, make sure npm is installed, enter the destination_folder folder, and run(Linux):
    
    sudo npm install bower
    node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
    
This will first locally install bower, and then used that bower to install the project dependencies. 


### Running

You should now be able to open the example.html in the browser.


### Building

First, install all build tools, in the destination_folder folder, run

    sudo npm install


The cycle for development is change and then build. 
If you want to make any changes, you should make them in the /src-files and then build, otherwise your changes
will not be included in the example. 

From the installation, gulp should be installed, so therefore, in the destination_folder folder, just run: 
   
    gulp default
   
This starts a build and generates destination_folder/angular-schema-form-minimal.js and destination_folder/angular-schema-form-minimal.min.js.
To observe your changes, just refresh the example.html-page.
