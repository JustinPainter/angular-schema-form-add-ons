<!--
This is the implementation of the view.

All references to css classes here are for bootstrap classes, for them to work, Bootstrap has to be installed.

IMPORTANT: The ASF magic $$value$$ will be changed by ASF into model['minimal_format'] or model['minimal_form_type']
during compilation. This is the recommended way to access the model until there is a better solution.
-->

<!-- hasError is implemented by ASF and returns true if there is a validation error. -->
<div ng-class="{'has-error': hasError()}">
    <!-- The showTitle function is implemented by ASF, returns true if the title should be shown -->
    <label ng-show="showTitle()">{{form.title}}</label>

    <!-- This is the input-->
    <div>
        <!-- Bind the input to the model-->
        <input ng-model="$$value$$"><span> <-- This is the minimal editor</span>
    </div>
    <!-- hasError() and the other functions are also defined by ASF, so this will either
        show a validation error or the description -->
    <span class="help-block">{{ (hasError() && errorMessage(schemaError())) || form.description}}</span>
</div>
